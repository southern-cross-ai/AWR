The [AWR](https://www.womenaustralia.info) is a product of the Australian Women’s Archives Program
The Australian Women’s Archives Program (AWAP), established in 1999 as the Australian Women’s Archives Project, is a long-standing collaboration between the University of Melbourne and the National Foundation for Australian Women (NFAW). 

It was created to build knowledge and recognition of the social, cultural, historical and economic contribution made by Australian women to public and private life. The AWR was a key plank in the AWAP strategy.
